# Shape As Points - Training Environment Setup Status

## ✅ Environment Setup Complete

### 🔧 Verified Components
- **Python Environment**: `/root/anaconda3/envs/py310-dmc/bin/python` ✅
- **PyTorch**: 2.8.0+cu128 with CUDA support ✅  
- **torch_scatter**: 2.1.2+pt28cu128 ✅
- **PyTorch3D**: Working correctly ✅
- **DPSR Module**: Tested and functional ✅
- **Demo Generation**: Successfully tested ✅

### 📁 Available Data
- **Demo Data**: ✅ Available at `data/demo/`
  - Chair point clouds (`data/demo/shapenet_chair/`)
  - Lamp point clouds (`data/demo/shapenet_lamp/`)
  - 3D wheel model (`data/demo/wheel.ply`)

### 🎯 Next Steps for Training

Since the training environment is fully ready, you have two options:

## Option 1: Quick Dataset Download & Training

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
./download_and_setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Download the ShapeNet dataset (~85GB compressed)
- Extract it to the correct location
- Verify the setup
- Provide training instructions

**Estimated time**: 45-90 minutes depending on internet speed

## Option 2: Manual Training Start

If you want to start immediately with the dataset download in background:

```bash
# Start download in background
nohup bash scripts/download_shapenet.sh &

# Monitor progress
./monitor_download.sh

# Once complete, start training
./start_training.sh
```

## 📊 Training Configuration

**Default Config**: `configs/learning_based/noise_large/ours.yaml`

**Key Settings**:
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 5e-4  
- Total epochs: 400,000
- Grid resolution: 128³
- Output: `out/shapenet/noise_025_ours/`

**Monitoring**:
- Validation: Every 5,000 steps
- Checkpoints: Every 200 steps
- Visualizations: Every 5,000 steps

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `./download_and_setup.sh` | Complete automated setup |
| `./start_training.sh` | Start training (requires dataset) |
| `./monitor_download.sh` | Monitor download progress |
| `python generate.py configs/learning_based/demo_large_noise.yaml` | Test with pretrained model |

## 🎮 Testing the Environment

You can test that everything works by running generation with pretrained models:

```bash
# Test large noise handling
python generate.py configs/learning_based/demo_large_noise.yaml

# Test outlier handling  
python generate.py configs/learning_based/demo_outlier.yaml

# Test optimization-based reconstruction
python optim_hierarchy.py configs/optim_based/teaser.yaml
```

## ✅ Environment Status: READY

All dependencies verified, demo data available, scripts configured. 
**Ready to download dataset and start training!**
